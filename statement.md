# Project Statement

**Problem Statement:**  
Manual tracking of patient, doctor, and appointment data in small clinics is error-prone and inefficient. Automating these records allows better management and fewer mistakes.

**Scope:**  
- Management of patient, doctor, and appointment data
- Booking with conflict checking
- Simple search, reporting, and persistent file storage
- CLI-based; no web or GUI features

**Target Users:**
Clinic administrative staff and receptionists

**High-Level Features:**
- Add/update/delete/list patients and doctors
- Book/list/cancel appointments
- Search patients/doctors/appointments
